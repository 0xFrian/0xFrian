# 👋 Hello! Welcome to my GitHub page (ﾉ◠ ͜ ◠)ﾉ*:⋆･ﾟ✧

### 🌷 About Me
Grew up and currently based in the San Gabriel Valley area in California (626). In a previous life, I studied physics and pursued a career in physics education at [UC Irvine](https://uci.edu/) as a teacher's assistant and Jr. researcher. After graduating, I pivoted careers into software engineering, specifically smart contract development. 

### 🏗️ Work
#### [Solidity Journey](https://github.com/0xFrian/solidity-journey) 
 * This GitHub repository serves as an introduction to deploying and interacting with **Solidity** smart contracts on **Ethereum** testnets using **JavaScript**, **ethers.js**, **Hardhat**, and **Alchemy**. 

#### Coursework, Research, and Teaching Materials (Archived): 
 * A collection of materials documenting my coursework, research, and teaching at UC Irvine. 


### ⌨️ Hobbies
I believe everyone should try building a custom mechanical keyboard suited to their preferences. I've built/modified more than a dozen mech keebs. Currently my daily driver is a [Mode SixtyFive](https://modedesigns.com/blogs/updates/updates-introducing-the-sixtyfive) with Gateron Black Ink switches.
